👋 I'm excited to share with you a Python program I recently developed to streamline the process of generating certificates in bulk. This program is designed to automate the creation of certificates based on information provided in an Excel sheet and a PowerPoint template.

Features:
Bulk Certificate Generation: Efficiently generate certificates in bulk.
Customizable Templates: Design certificates in PowerPoint with dynamic placeholders (<<>>).
User-Friendly: Simple and Easy-to-use GUI with tkinter for file selections.

How to Use:
📂 Select Excel File: Choose an Excel sheet containing participant information.
🖼️ Select PPTX Template: Design your certificate in PowerPoint with dynamic placeholders (<<text>>).
📁 Select Destination Folder: Choose where the generated certificates will be saved.
🚀 Start Merging: Run the program, and watch as personalized certificates are created!

**The names in the excel and the pptx must match.**
Example the word rollnumber(column name) in excel must be written as <<rollnumber>> in pptx file.

Requirements:
Python (3.x recommended)
tkinter
pandas
python-pptx
